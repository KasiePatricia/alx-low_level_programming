Requirements:
Language: C
OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
Style guidelines: [Betty style] 

Synopsis:
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:
How to use arguments passed to your program
What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
How to use attribute((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

Description:
Task 0 - a program that prints its name
Task 1 - a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
Task 2 - a program that prints all arguments it receives
Task 3 - a program that multiplies two numbers
Task 4 - a program that adds positive numbers
Task 5 - a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money
