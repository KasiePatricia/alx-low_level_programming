More pointers, arrays, and strings

Requirements
Language: C
OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc
Style guidelines: Betty style

Synopsis
The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:
pointers
arrays
strings

Description of what each file does:

Task 0. function that concatenates two strings
Task 1. function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string
Task 2. function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes
Task 3. function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values
Task 4. function that reverses the content of an array of integers
Task 5. function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercas
Task 6. function that capitalizes first letter of all words of a string
Task 7. function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)
Task 8. function that encodes a string using rot13
Task 9. function that prints an integer
Task 10. modify set code so program prints a[2] = 98 under certain constraints
	not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
	not allowed to modify the variable p
	not allowed to use ,
	not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
	code should be written at line 19, before the ;
	donâ€™t change anything but the line of code you are adding
Task 11. function that adds two numbers
Task 12. function that prints a buffer.
